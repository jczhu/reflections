How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    We knew the original file was functional, but the new file was not, even though the changes were only superficial. By comparing the old file to the new file, we were able to find changes that were not intentional (changes that we didn't know were made, for example).

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If you make a mistake/change, you can look back to an older version. If you in addition keep track of when something works, but then change something later that makes it not work, you can look at the time when it worked and see what other changes were made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually saving results in effective division of changes from one version to another. If things are saved automatically, you might get some weird divisions (e.g. half a line)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Different uses. Git is more for code, which more often would use such a function (e.g. changing variable name, class name, method name -->would need to change everything else that uses those names). Google docs on the other hand are typically only word files that would not really need this function.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to find the ids, git diff old_id new_id to find the change between the two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I break something, I can just check go back to a working version, check it out, branch and work on the new brance (I also believe I can make that branch a new branch, but that's later I think)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Really want to use Git to upload my old code. It would also be useful for my current code. I once remember copying and pasting one working version of code into a different window so I could test some things. WIth version control, I just need to checkout :D
