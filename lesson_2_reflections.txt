What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	.git file is added to the folder where git init was called to create a repository. Need to do it so git can create it metadata/history? There will be nothing in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is an in-between the repository and the working directory. It offers the value of giving the user a space to decide what goes into a commit, because users can make errors.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	can use git diff --staged to see what changes were made compared to the most recent commit. If it's too big a commit, idk what to do? Could you unstage just that one file? Not sure, but you'll be able to know how much you're changing before you commit.
